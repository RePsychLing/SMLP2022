    "text": "Unlike R, Julia does not immediately expose a huge number of functions, but instead requires loading packages (whether from the standard library or from the broader package ecosystem) for a lot of relevant functionality for statistical analysis. There are technical reasons for this, but one further motivation is that Julia is at a broader ‚Äútechnical computing‚Äù audience (like MATLAB or perhaps Python) and less at a ‚Äústatistical analysis‚Äù audience.\nThis has two important implications:\nThis notebook is not intended to be an exhaustive list of packages, but rather to highlight a few packages that I suspect will be particularly useful. Before getting onto the packages, I have one final hint: take advantage of how easy and first-class package management in Julia is. Having good package management makes reproducible analyses much easier and avoids breaking old analyses when you start a new one. Pluto helpfully installs and manages for you, but the package-manager REPL mode (activated by typing ] at the julia> prompt) is very useful."

(Confusingly, the function for reading and writing Arrow format files in R is called read_feather and write_feather, but the modern Arrow format is distinct from the older Feather format provided by the feather package.) This is the format that we store the example and test datasets in for MixedModels.jl.\nCSV.jl useful for reading comma-separated values, tab-separated values and basically everything handled by the read.csv and read.table family of functions in R.\n\nNote that by default both Arrow.jl and CSV.jl do not return a DataFrame, but rather ‚Äúcolumn tables‚Äù ‚Äì named tuples of column vectors.\n\n\nDataFrames\nUnlike in R, DataFrames are not part of the base language, nor the standard library.\nDataFrames.jl provides the basic infrastructure around DataFrames, as well as its own mini language for doing the split-apply-combine approach that underlies R‚Äôs dplyr and much of the tidyverse. The DataFrames.jl documentation is the place to for looking at how to e.g.¬†read in a CSV or Arrow file as a DataFrame. Note that DataFrames.jl by default depends on CategoricalArrays.jl to handle the equivalent of factor in the R world, but there is an alternative package for factor-like array type in Julia, PooledArrays.jl. PooledArrays are simpler, but more limited than CategoricalArrays and we (Phillip and Doug) sometimes use them in our examples and simulations.\nDataFrame.jl‚Äôs mini language can be a bit daunting, if you‚Äôre used to manipulations in the style of base R or the tidyverse. For that, there are several options; recently, we‚Äôe had particularly nice experiences with DataFrameMacros.jl and Chain.jl for a convenient syntax to connect or ‚Äúpipe‚Äù together successive operations. It‚Äôs your choice whether and which of these add-ons you want to use! Phillip tends to write his code using raw DataFrames.jl, but Doug really enjoys DataFrameMacros.jl."

    "section": "Regression",
    "text": "Regression\nUnlike in R, neither formula processing nor basic regression are part of the base language or the standard library.\nThe formula syntax and basic contrast-coding schemes in Julia is provided by StatsModels.jl. By default, MixedModels.jl re-exports the @formula macro and most commonly used contrast schemes from StatsModels.jl, so you often don‚Äôt have to worry about loading StatsModels.jl directly. The same is true for GLM.jl, which provides basic linear and generalized linear models, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and logistic regression, i.e.¬†the classical, non mixed regression models.\nThe basic functionality looks quite similar to R, e.g.\njulia > lm(@formula(y ~ 1 + x), data)\njulia > glm(@formula(y ~ 1 + x), data, Binomial(), LogitLink())\nbut the more general modelling API (also used by MixedModels.jl) is also supported:\njulia > fit(LinearModel, @formula(y ~ 1 + x), mydata)\njulia > fit(\n  GeneralizedLinearModel,\n  @formula(y ~ 1 + x),\n  data,\n  Binomial(),\n  LogitLink(),\n)\n(You can also specify your model matrices directly and skip the formula interface, but we don‚Äôt recommend this as it‚Äôs easy to mess up in really subtle but very probelmatic ways.)\n\n@formula, macros and domain-specific languages\nAs a sidebar: why is @formula a macro and not a normal function? Well, that‚Äôs because formulas are essentially their own domain-specific language (a variant of Wilkinson-Roger notation) and macros are used for manipulating the language itself ‚Äì or in this case, handling an entirely new, embedded language! This is also why macros are used by packages like Turing.jl and Soss.jl that define a language for Bayesian probabilistic programming like PyMC3 or Stan.\n\n\nExtensions to the formula syntax\nThere are several ongoing efforts to extend the formula syntax to include some of the ‚Äúextras‚Äù available in R, e.g.¬†RegressionFormulae.jl to use the caret (^) notation to limit interactions to a certain order ((a+b+c)^2 generates a + b + c + a&b + a&c + b&c, but not a&b&c). Note also that Julia uses & to express interactions, not : like in R.\n\n\nStandardizing Predictors\nAlthough function calls such as log can be used within Julia formulae, they must act on a rowwise basis, i.e.¬†on observations. Transformations such as z-scoring or centering (often done with scale in R) require knowledge of the entire column. StandardizedPredictors.jl provides functions for centering, scaling, and z-scoring within the formula. These are treated as pseudo-contrasts and computed on demand, meaning that predict and effects (see next) computations will handle these transformations on new data (e.g.¬†centering new data around the mean computed during fitting the original data) correctly and automatically.\n\n\nEffects\nJohn Fox‚Äôs effects package in R (and the related ggeffects package for plotting these using ggplot2) provides a nice way to visualize a model‚Äôs overall view of the data. This functionality is provided by Effects.jl and works out-of-the-box with most regression model packages in Julia (including MixedModels.jl). Support for formulae with embedded functions (such as log) is not yet complete, but we‚Äôre working on it!\n\n\nEstimated Marginal / Least Square Means\nEffects.jl provides a subset of the functionality (basic estimated-marginal means and exhaustive pairwise comparisons) of the R package emmeans package. However, it is often better to use sensible, hypothesis-driven contrast coding than to compute all pairwise comparisons after the fact. üòÉ"

Makie.jl itself only provides abstract definitions for many components (and is used in e.g.¬†MixedModelsMakie.jl to define plot types for MixedModels.jl). The actual plotting and rendering is handled by a backend package such as CairoMakie.jl (good for Quarto notebooks or rending static 2D images) and GLMakie.jl (good for dynamic, interactive visuals and 3D images). AlgebraOfGraphics.jl builds a grammar of graphics upon the Makie framework. It‚Äôs a great way to get good plots very quickly, but extensive customization is still best achieved by using Makie directly.\n\n\nPlots.jl\nPlots.jl is the original plotting package in Julia, but we often find it difficult to work with compared to some of the other alternatives. StatsPlots.jl builds on this, adding common statistical plots, while UnicodePlots.jl renders plots as Unicode characters directly in the REPL.\nPGFPlotsX.jl is a very new package that writes directly to PGF (the format used by LaTeX‚Äôs tikz framework) and can stand alone or be used as a rendering backend for the Plots.jl ecosystem.\n\n\nGadfly\nGadfly.jl was the original attempt to create a plotting system in Julia based on the grammar of graphics (the ‚Äúgg‚Äù in ggplot2). Development has largely stalled, but some functionality still exceeds AlgebraOfGraphics.jl, which has taken up the grammar of graphics mantle. Notably, the MixedModels.jl documentation still uses Gadfly as of this writing (early September 2021).\n\n\nOthers\nThere are many other graphics packages available in Julia, often wrapping well-established frameworks such as VegaLite."

RData.jl provides support for reading .rds and .rda files from Julia, while RDatasets.jl provides convenient access to many of the standard datasets provided by R and various R packages.\nPyCall.jl provides a very convenient way for interacting with Python code and packages. PyPlot.jl builds upon this foundation to provide support for Python‚Äôs matplotlib. Similarly, PyMNE.jl and PyFOOOF.jl provide some additional functionality to make interacting with MNE-Python and FOOOF from within Julia even easier than with vanilla PyCall.

The shift in the intercept has a standard deviation of about 24 ms. which would suggest a range of about 200 ms. to 300 ms. in the intercepts. Similarly within-subject slopes would be expected to have a range of about 0 ms./day up to 20 ms./day.\nThe random effects for the slope and for the intercept are allowed to be correlated within subject.

We‚Äôre not sure what to make of that.\nIn both cases the sum of the leverage values is toward the upper end of the range of possible values, which is the rank of the fixed-effects model matrix (2) up to the rank of the fixed-effects plus the random effects model matrix (2 + 36 = 38).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI think that the upper bound may be 36, not 38, because the two columns of X lie in the column span of Z\n\n\nThis comparison does show, however, that a simple count of the parameters in a mixed-effects model can underestimate, sometimes drastically, the model complexity. This is because a single variance component or multiple components can add many dimensions to the linear predictor."

The random effects are modeled as unobserved random variables.\nThe conditional means of these random variables, sometimes called the BLUPs or Best Linear Unbiased Predictors, are not simply the least squares estimates. They are attenuated or shrunk towards zero to reflect the fact that the individuals are assumed to come from a population. A shrinkage plot, Figure¬†3, shows the BLUPs from the model fit compared to the values without any shrinkage. If the BLUPs are similar to the unshrunk values then the more complicated model accounting for individual differences is supported. If the BLUPs are strongly shrunk towards zero then the additional complexity in the model to account for individual differences is not providing sufficient increase in fidelity to the data to warrant inclusion.\n\n\nCode\nshrinkageplot!(Figure(; resolution=(500, 500)), m1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Shrinkage plot of means of the random effects in model m1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis plot could be drawn as shrinkageplot(m1). The reason for explicitly creating a Figure to be modified by shrinkageplot! is to control the resolution.\n\n\nThis plot shows an intermediate pattern. The random effects are somewhat shrunk toward the origin, a model simplification trend, but not completely shrunk - indicating that fidelity to the data is enhanced with these additional coefficients in the linear predictor.\nIf the shrinkage were primarily in one direction - for example, if the arrows from the unshrunk values to the shrunk values were mostly in the vertical direction - then we would get an indication that we could drop the random effect for slope and revert to a simpler model. This is not the case here.\nAs would be expected, the unshrunk values that are further from the origin tend to be shrunk more toward the origin. That is, the arrows that originate furthest from the origin are longer. However, that is not always the case. The arrow in the upper right corner, from S337, is relatively short. Examination of the panel for S337 in the data plot shows a strong linear trend, even though both the intercept and the slope are unusually large. The neighboring panels in the data plot, S330 and S331, have more variability around the least squares line and are subject to a greater amount of shrinkage in the model. (They correspond to the two arrows on the right hand side of the figure around -5 on the vertical scale.)"

    "text": "Assessing variability by bootstrapping\nThe speed of fitting linear mixed-effects models using MixedModels.jl allows for using simulation-based approaches to inference instead of relying on approximate standard errors. A parametric bootstrap sample for model m is a collection of models of the same form as m fit to data values simulated from m. That is, we pretend that m and its parameter values are the true parameter values, simulate data from these values, and estimate parameters from the simulated data.\nSimulating and fitting a substantial number of model fits, 5000 in this case, takes only a few seconds, following which we extract a data frame of the parameter estimates and plot densities of some of these estimates.\n\nrng = Random.seed!(42)    # initialize a random number generator\nm1bstp = parametricbootstrap(rng, 5000, m1; hide_progress=true)\nallpars = DataFrame(m1bstp.allpars)\n\n\n30,000 rows √ó 5 columnsitertypegroupnamesvalueInt64StringString?String?Float6411Œ≤missing(Intercept)260.71221Œ≤missingdays9.8497531œÉsubj(Intercept)15.331741œÉsubjdays6.4029651œÅsubj(Intercept), days-0.025958261œÉresidualmissing23.409272Œ≤missing(Intercept)262.25382Œ≤missingdays12.300892œÉsubj(Intercept)16.3183102œÉsubjdays5.54688112œÅsubj(Intercept), days0.552607122œÉresidualmissing25.7047133Œ≤missing(Intercept)253.149143Œ≤missingdays12.879153œÉsubj(Intercept)25.4787163œÉsubjdays6.1444173œÅsubj(Intercept), days0.0691545183œÉresidualmissing22.2753194Œ≤missing(Intercept)263.376204Œ≤missingdays11.5798214œÉsubj(Intercept)18.8039224œÉsubjdays4.6557234œÅsubj(Intercept), days0.103361244œÉresidualmissing23.3128255Œ≤missing(Intercept)248.429265Œ≤missingdays9.39444275œÉsubj(Intercept)20.1411285œÉsubjdays5.27358295œÅsubj(Intercept), days-0.163603305œÉresidualmissing25.4355‚ãÆ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ\n\n\nAn empirical density plot of the estimates for the fixed-effects coefficients, Figure¬†4, shows the normal distribution, ‚Äúbell-curve‚Äù, shape as we might expect.\n\n\nCode\nbegin\n  f1 = Figure(; resolution=(1000, 400))\n  CairoMakie.density!(\n    Axis(f1[1, 1]; xlabel=\"Intercept [ms]\"),\n    @subset(allpars, :type == \"Œ≤\" && :names == \"(Intercept)\").value,\n  )\n  CairoMakie.density!(\n    Axis(f1[1, 2]; xlabel=\"Coefficient of days [ms/day]\"),\n    @subset(allpars, :type == \"Œ≤\" && :names == \"days\").value,\n  )\n  f1\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Empirical density plots of bootstrap replications of fixed-effects parameter estimates\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to create interval estimates of the parameters from the bootstrap replicates.

    "text": "Belenky et al. (2003) reported effects of sleep deprivation across a 14-day study of 30-to-40-year old men and women holding commercial vehicle driving licenses. Their analyses are based on a subset of tasks and ratings from very large and comprehensive test and questionnaire battery (Balkin et al., 2000).\nInitially 66 subjects were assigned to one of four time-in-bed (TIB) groups with 9 hours (22:00-07:00) of sleep augmentation or 7 hours (24:00-07:00), 5 hours (02:00-07:00), and 3 hours (04:00-0:00) of sleep restrictions per night, respectively. The final sample comprised 56 subjects. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures simple reaction time to a visual stimulus, presented approximately 10 times ‚ÅÑ minute (interstimulus interval varied from 2 to 10 s in 2-s increments) for 10 min and implemented in a thumb-operated, hand-held device (Dinges & Powell, 1985).\nDesign\nThe study comprised 2 training days (T1, T2), one day with baseline measures (B), seven days with sleep deprivation (E1 to E7), and four recovery days (R1 to R4). T1 and T2 were devoted to training on the performance tests and familiarization with study procedures. PVT baseline testing commenced on the morning of the third day (B) and testing continued for the duration of the study (E1‚ÄìE7, R1‚ÄìR3; no measures were taken on R4). Bed times during T, B, and R days were 8 hours (23:00-07:00).\nTest schedule within days\nThe PVT (along with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) was administered as a battery four times per day (09:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 21:00 h); the battery included other tests not reported here (see Balkin et al., 2000). The sleep latency test was administered at 09:40 and 15:30 h for all groups. Subjects in the 3- and 5-h TIB groups performed an additional battery at 00:00 h and 02:00 h to occupy their additional time awake. The PVT and SSS were administered in this battery; however, as data from the 00:00 and 02:00 h sessions were not common to all TIB groups, these data were not included in the statistical analyses reported in the paper.\nStatistical analyses\nThe authors analyzed response speed, that is (1/RT)*1000 ‚Äì completely warranted according to a Box-Cox check of the current data ‚Äì with mixed-model ANOVAs using group as between- and day as within-subject factors. The ANOVA was followed up with simple tests of the design effects implemented over days for each of the four groups.\nCurrent data\nThe current data distributed with the RData collection is attributed to the 3-hour TIB group, but the means do not agree at all with those reported for this group in (Belenky et al., 2003, fig. 3) where the 3-hour TIB group is also based on only 13 (not 18) subjects. Specifically, the current data show a much smaller slow-down of response speed across E1 to E7 and do not reflect the recovery during R1 to R3. The currrent data also cover only 10 not 11 days, but it looks like only R3 is missing. The closest match of the current means was with the average of the 3-hour and 7-hour TIB groups; if only males were included, this would amount to 18 subjects. (This conjecture is based only on visual inspection of graphs.)"

This is like a read-only data frame, which can be easily converted to a full-fledged DataFrame if desired.\nThis arrangement allows for the Arrow package not to depend on the DataFrames package, which is a heavy-weight dependency, but still easily produce a DataFrame if warranted.\nLoad the packages to be used.\n\n\nCode\n# use the project in the current working directory\nusing Pkg; Pkg.activate(\".\")\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics\nusing Arrow\nusing CairoMakie\nusing Chain\nusing DataFrameMacros\nusing DataFrames\nusing Downloads\nusing KernelDensity\nusing PythonCall  # show reading Arrow in Python\nusing RCall   # show reading Arrow in R\nusing StatsBase\n\nCairoMakie.activate!(; type=\"svg\")\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics: density\n\n\n  Activating project at `~/Work/SMLP2022`\n\n\n‚îå Info: Precompiling AlgebraOfGraphics [cbdf2221-f076-402e-a563-3d30da359d67]\n‚îî @ Base loading.jl:1662\n\n\n‚îå Info: Precompiling PythonCall [6099a3de-0909-46bc-b1f4-468b9a2dfc0d]\n‚îî @ Base loading.jl:1662\n\n\n    CondaPkg Found dependencies: /home/phillip/Work/SMLP2022/CondaPkg.toml\n\n\n    CondaPkg Found dependencies: /home/phillip/.julia/packages/PythonCall/2Y5CR/CondaPkg.toml\n\n\n    CondaPkg Dependencies already up to date"

    "section": "Avoiding needless repetition",
    "text": "Avoiding needless repetition\nOne of the principles of relational database design is that information should not be repeated needlessly. Each row of df is determined by a combination of Child and Test, together producing a score, which can be converted to a zScore.\nThe other columns in the table, Cohort, School, age, and Sex, are properties of the Child.\nStoring these values redundantly in the full table takes up space but, more importantly, allows for inconsistency. As it stands, a given Child could be recorded as being in one Cohort for the Run test and in another Cohort for the S20_r test and nothing about the table would detect this as being an error.\nThe approach used in relational databases is to store the information for score in one table that contains only Child, Test and score, store the information for the Child in another table including Cohort, School, age and Sex. These tables can then be combined to create the table to be used for analysis by joining the different tables together.\nThe maintainers of the DataFrames package have put in a lot of work over the past few years to make joins quite efficient in Julia. Thus the processing penalty of reassembling the big table from three smaller tables is minimal.\nIt is important to note that the main advantage of using smaller tables that are joined together to produce the analysis table is the fact that the information in the analysis table is consistent by design."

    "text": "Generalized Linear Mixed Models\nConsider first a GLMM for a vector, \\(\\bf y\\), of binary (i.e.¬†yes/no) responses. The probability model for the conditional distribution \\(\\mathcal Y|\\mathcal B=\\bf b\\) consists of independent Bernoulli distributions where the mean, \\(\\mu_i\\), for the i‚Äôth response is again determined by the i‚Äôth element of a linear predictor, \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta+\\mathbf{Z b}\\).\nHowever, in this case we will run into trouble if we try to make \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu=\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) because \\(\\mu_i\\) is the probability of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù for the i‚Äôth response and must be between 0 and 1. We can‚Äôt guarantee that the i‚Äôth component of \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) will be between 0 and 1. To get around this problem we apply a transformation to take \\(\\eta_i\\) to \\(\\mu_i\\). For historical reasons this transformation is called the inverse link, written \\(g^{-1}\\), and the opposite transformation - from the probability scale to an unbounded scale - is called the link, g.\nEach probability distribution in the exponential family (which is most of the important ones), has a canonical link which comes from the form of the distribution itself. The details aren‚Äôt as important as recognizing that the distribution itself determines a preferred link function.\nFor the Bernoulli distribution, the canonical link is the logit or log-odds function, \\[\n\\eta = g(\\mu) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}\\right),\n\\] (it‚Äôs called log-odds because it is the logarithm of the odds ratio, \\(p/(1-p)\\)) and the canonical inverse link is the logistic \\[\n\\mu=g^{-1}(\\eta)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\eta)}.\n\\] This is why fitting a binary response is sometimes called logistic regression.\nFor later use we define a Julia logistic function. See this presentation for more information than you could possible want to know on how Julia converts code like this to run on the processor.\n\nincrement(x) = x + one(x)\nlogistic(Œ∑) = inv(increment(exp(-Œ∑)))\n\nlogistic (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nTo reiterate, the probability model for a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{B}=\\bf{b}) &\\sim\\mathcal{D}(\\bf{g^{-1}(X\\boldsymbol\\beta + Z b)},\\phi)\\\\\\\\\n\\mathcal{B}&\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol\\theta}) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is the distribution family (such as Bernoulli or Poisson), \\(g^{-1}\\) is the inverse link and \\(\\phi\\) is a scale parameter for \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) if it has one. The important cases of the Bernoulli and Poisson distributions don‚Äôt have a scale parameter - once you know the mean you know everything you need to know about the distribution.

Unfortunately, the version of the data to which I had access did not record what the centering value was.\nA data plot, drawn using lattice graphics in R, shows that the probability of contraception use is not linear in age - it is low for younger women, higher for women in the middle of the range (assumed to be women in late 20‚Äôs to early 30‚Äôs) and low again for older women (late 30‚Äôs to early 40‚Äôs in this survey).\nIf we fit a model with only the age term in the fixed effects, that term will not be significant.

Thus the distinction of 1, 2, or 3+ childen is not as important as the contrast between having any children and not having any.

Nevertheless we see that the deviance is much lower in the model with age & children even though the 3 levels of livch have been collapsed into a single level of children. There is a substantial decrease in the deviance even though there are fewer parameters in model gm2 than in gm1. This decrease is because the flexibility of the model - its ability to model the behavior of the response - is being put to better use in gm2 than in gm1.\nAt present the calculation of the geomdof as sum(influence(m)) is not correctly defined in our code for a GLMM so we need to do some more work before we can examine those values.\n\n\nUsing urban&dist as a grouping factor\nIt turns out that there can be more difference between urban and rural settings within the same political district than there is between districts.

    "text": "We take the kwdyz11.arrow dataset (Kliegl et al., 2010) from an experiment looking at three effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). Two horizontal rectangles are displayed above and below a central fixation point or they displayed in vertical orientation to the left and right of the fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small visual target occuring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. At the level of fixed effects, there is the noteworthy result, that the attraction effect was estimated at 2 ms, that is clearly not significant. Nevertheless, there was a highly reliable variance component (VC) estimated for this effect. Moreover, the reliable individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nUnfortunately, a few years after the publication, we determined that the reported LMM is actually singular and that the singularity is linked to a theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect. Fortunately, there is also a larger dataset kkl15.arrow from a replication and extension of this study (Kliegl et al., 2015), analyzed with kkl15.jl notebook. The critical CP (along with other fixed effects and CPs) was replicated in this study.\nA more comprehensive analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015). Data and R scripts are also available in R-package RePsychLing. In this and the complementary kkl15.jl scripts, we provide some corresponding analyses with MixedModels.jl."

    "text": "Kliegl et al. (2015) is a follow-up to Kliegl et al. (2010) (see also script mmt_kwdyz11.qmd) from an experiment looking at a variety of effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). In this experiment two rectangles are displayed (1) in horizontal orientation , (2) in vertical orientation, (3) in left diagonal orientation, or in (4) right diagonal orientation relative to a central fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small or a large visual target occuring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each. This implies a latent imbalance in design that is not visiable in the repeated-measures ANOVA, but we will show its effect in the random-effect structure and conditional modes.\nThere are a couple of differences between the first and this follow-up experiment, rendering it more a conceptual than a direct replication. First, the original experiment was carried out at Peking University and this follow-up at Potsdam University. Second, diagonal orientations of rectangles and large target sizes were not part of the design of Kliegl et al. (2010). To keep matters somewhat simpler and comparable we ignore them in this script.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. Replicating Kliegl et al. (2010), the attraction effect was not significant as a fixed effect, but yielded a highly reliable variance component (VC; i.e., reliable individual differences in positive and negative attraction effects cancel the fixed effect). Moreover, these individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nThis comparison is of interest because a few years after the publication of Kliegl et al. (2010), the theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect was determined as the source of a non-singular LMM in that paper. The present study served the purpose to estimate this parameter with a larger sample and a wider variety of experimental conditions. Therefore, the code in this script is largely the same as the one in kwdyz.jl.\nThere will be another vignette modelling the additional experimental manipulations of target size and orientation of cue rectangle. This analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015); they were also used in a paper of GAMMs (Baayen et al., 2017). Data and R scripts are also available in R-package RePsychLing. Here we provide some of the corresponding analyses with MixedModels.jl and a much wider variety of visualizations of LMM results. A MixedModels.jl-based analysis focusing on the complex experimental design and the analysis of a complex random-effect structure for this design is in script kkl15_complex.jl."

The corresponding plot based on LMM m1_rt for raw reaction times still shows them with very wide distributions, but acceptable."

    "title": "Mixed Models Tutorial: Contrast Coding",
    "section": "2. Contrast coding",
    "text": "2. Contrast coding\nContrast coding is part of StatsModels.jl. Here is the primary author‚Äôs (i.e., Dave Kleinschmidt‚Äôs documentation of Modeling Categorical Data.\nThe random factors Child, School, and Cohort are assigned a Grouping contrast. This contrast is needed when the number of groups (i.e., units, levels) is very large. This is the case for Child (i.e., the 108,925 children in the full and probably also the 11,566 children in the reduced data set). The assignment is not necessary for the typical sample size of experiments. However, we use this coding of random factors irrespective of the number of units associated with them to be transparent about the distinction between random and fixed factors.\nA couple of general remarks about the following examples. First, all contrasts defined in this tutorial return an estimate of the Grand Mean (GM) in the intercept, that is they are so-called sum-to-zero contrasts. In both Julia and R the default contrast is Dummy coding which is not a sum-to-zero contrast, but returns the mean of the reference (control) group - unfortunately for (quasi-)experimentally minded scientists.\nSecond, The factor Sex has only two levels. We use EffectCoding (also known as Sum coding in R) to estimate the difference of the levels from the Grand Mean. Unlike in R, the default sign of the effect is for the second level (base is the first, not the last level), but this can be changed with the base kwarg in the command. Effect coding is a sum-to-zero contrast, but when applied to factors with more than two levels does not yield orthogonal contrasts.\nFinally, contrasts for the five levels of the fixed factor Test represent the hypotheses about differences between them. In this tutorial, we use this factor to illustrate various options.\nWe (initially) include only Test as fixed factor and Child as random factor. More complex LMMs can be specified by simply adding other fixed or random factors to the formula.\n\n2.1 SeqDiffCoding: contr1\nSeqDiffCoding was used in the publication. This specification tests pairwise differences between the five neighboring levels of Test, that is:\n\nSDC1: 2-1\nSDC2: 3-2\nSDC3: 4-3\nSDC4: 5-4\n\nThe levels were sorted such that these contrasts map onto four a priori hypotheses; in other words, they are theoretically motivated pairwise comparisons. The motivation also encompasses theoretically motivated interactions with Sex. The order of levels can also be explicitly specified during contrast construction. This is very useful if levels are in a different order in the dataframe. We recommend the explicit specification to increase transparency of the code.\nThe statistical disadvantage of SeqDiffCoding is that the contrasts are not orthogonal, that is the contrasts are correlated. This is obvious from the fact that levels 2, 3, and 4 are all used in two contrasts. One consequence of this is that correlation parameters estimated between neighboring contrasts (e.g., 2-1 and 3-2) are difficult to interpret. Usually, they will be negative because assuming some practical limitation on the overall range (e.g., between levels 1 and 3), a small ‚Äú2-1‚Äù effect ‚Äúcorrelates‚Äù negatively with a larger ‚Äú3-2‚Äù effect for mathematical reasons.\nObviously, the tradeoff between theoretical motivation and statistical purity is something that must be considered carefully when planning the analysis.\n\ncontr1 = merge(\n  Dict(nm => Grouping() for nm in (:School, :Child, :Cohort)),\n  Dict(\n    :Sex => EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n    :Test => SeqDiffCoding(;\n      levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"]\n    ),\n  ),\n)\n\nDict{Symbol, StatsModels.AbstractContrasts} with 5 entries:\n  :Child  => Grouping()\n  :School => Grouping()\n  :Test   => SeqDiffCoding([\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"])\n  :Cohort => Grouping()\n  :Sex    => EffectsCoding(nothing, [\"Girls\", \"Boys\"])\n\n\n\nf_ovi_1 = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test + (1 | Child);\n\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_1 = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi_1, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\nMinimizing 17    Time: 0:00:00 (15.03 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.0014\n0.0142\n0.10\n0.9229\n0.6192\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0024\n0.0445\n-0.05\n0.9568\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0088\n0.0445\n-0.20\n0.8434\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0030\n0.0444\n0.07\n0.9466\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.0089\n0.0445\n0.20\n0.8408\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7843\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, any differences between tests identified by the contrasts would be spurious because each test was standardized (i.e., M=0, \\(SD\\)=1). The differences could also be due to an imbalance in the number of boys and girls or in the number of missing observations for each test.\nThe primary interest in this study related to interactions of the test contrasts with and age and Sex. We start with age (linear) and its interaction with the four test contrasts.\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_2 = let\n  form = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 + (1 | Child)\n  fit(MixedModel, form, dat; contrasts=contr1)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0182\n0.0145\n-1.26\n0.2074\n0.6139\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0210\n0.0456\n-0.46\n0.6455\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0010\n0.0452\n0.02\n0.9832\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0133\n0.0450\n0.30\n0.7668\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0291\n0.0451\n-0.64\n0.5190\n\n\n\na1\n0.3236\n0.0488\n6.63\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.2370\n0.1525\n1.55\n0.1202\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n-0.0070\n0.1520\n-0.05\n0.9633\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.2485\n0.1527\n-1.63\n0.1038\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.6807\n0.1524\n4.47\n<1e-05\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7796\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between older and younger childrend is larger for Star_r than for Run (0.2473).

The sex difference is smaller when coordination and cognition play a role ‚Äì as in the Star_r test. (Caveat: SEs are estimated with an underspecified RES.)\nThe final step in this first series is to add the interactions between the three covariates. A significant interaction between any of the four Test contrasts and age (linear) x Sex was hypothesized to reflect a prepubertal signal (i.e., hormones start to rise in girls‚Äô ninth year of life). However, this hypothesis is linked to a specific shape of the interaction: Girls would need to gain more than boys in tests of muscular power.\n\nf_ovi = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 | Child)\nm_ovi_SeqDiff = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0182\n0.0141\n-1.29\n0.1971\n0.5752\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0180\n0.0444\n-0.40\n0.6859\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0017\n0.0440\n0.04\n0.9701\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0152\n0.0438\n0.35\n0.7283\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0308\n0.0439\n-0.70\n0.4833\n\n\n\na1\n0.3187\n0.0475\n6.71\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2207\n0.0141\n15.68\n<1e-54\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.1749\n0.1485\n1.18\n0.2391\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n-0.0127\n0.1481\n-0.09\n0.9316\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.2416\n0.1489\n-1.62\n0.1046\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.6625\n0.1485\n4.46\n<1e-05\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.1498\n0.0444\n-3.37\n0.0007\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n0.0399\n0.0440\n0.91\n0.3648\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0868\n0.0438\n1.98\n0.0472\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.0482\n0.0439\n1.10\n0.2727\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0288\n0.0475\n0.61\n0.5444\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0921\n0.1485\n0.62\n0.5353\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0523\n0.1481\n-0.35\n0.7240\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1782\n0.1489\n-1.20\n0.2311\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1690\n0.1485\n1.14\n0.2551\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7744\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are very clear: Despite an abundance of statistical power there is no evidence for the differences between boys and girls in how much they gain in the ninth year of life in these five tests. The authors argue that, in this case, absence of evidence looks very much like evidence of absence of a hypothesized interaction.\nIn the next two sections we use different contrasts. Does this have a bearing on this result? We still ignore for now that we are looking at anti-conservative test statistics.\n\n\n2.2 HelmertCoding: contr2\nThe second set of contrasts uses HelmertCoding. Helmert coding codes each level as the difference from the average of the lower levels. With the default order of Test levels we get the following test statistics which we describe in reverse order of appearance in model output\n\nHeC4: 5 - mean(1,2,3,4)\nHeC3: 4 - mean(1,2,3)\nHeC2: 3 - mean(1,2)\nHeC1: 2 - 1\n\nIn the model output, HeC1 will be reported first and HeC4 last.\nThere is some justification for the HeC4 specification in a post-hoc manner because the fifth test (BPT) turned out to be different from the other four tests in that high performance is most likely not only related to physical fitness, but also to overweight/obesity, that is for a subset of children high scores on this test might be indicative of physical unfitness. A priori the SDC4 contrast 5-4 between BPT (5) and SLJ (4) was motivated because conceptually both are tests of the physical fitness component Muscular Power, BPT for upper limbs and SLJ for lower limbs, respectively.\nOne could argue that there is justification for HeC3 because Run (1), Star_r (2), and S20 (3) involve running but SLJ (4) does not. Sports scientists, however, recoil. For them it does not make much sense to average the different running tests, because they draw on completely different physiological resources; it is a variant of the old apples-and-oranges problem.\nThe justification for HeC3 is thatRun (1) and Star_r (2) draw more strongly on cardiosrespiratory Endurance than S20 (3) due to the longer duration of the runs compared to sprinting for 20 m which is a pure measure of the physical-fitness component Speed. Again, sports scientists are not very happy with this proposal.\nFinally, HeC1 contrasts the fitness components Endurance, indicated best by Run (1), and Coordination, indicated by Star_r (2). Endurance (i.e., running for 6 minutes) is considered to be the best indicator of health-related status among the five tests because it is a rather pure measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. The Star_r test requires execution of a pre-instructed sequence of forward, sideways, and backward runs. This coordination of body movements implies a demand on working memory (i.e., remembering the order of these subruns) and executive control processes, but performats also depends on endurance. HeC1 yields a measure of Coordination ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù for the contribution of Endurance.\nThe statistical advantage of HelmertCoding is that the resulting contrasts are orthogonal (uncorrelated). This allows for optimal partitioning of variance and statistical power. It is also more efficient to estimate ‚Äúorthogonal‚Äù than ‚Äúnon-orthogonal‚Äù random-effect structures.\n\ncontr2 = Dict(\n  :School => Grouping(),\n  :Child => Grouping(),\n  :Cohort => Grouping(),\n  :Sex => EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n  :Test => HelmertCoding(;\n    levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"],\n  ),\n);\n\n\nm_ovi_Helmert = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0182\n0.0141\n-1.29\n0.1971\n0.5752\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0090\n0.0222\n-0.40\n0.6859\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0024\n0.0127\n-0.19\n0.8471\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0026\n0.0090\n0.29\n0.7739\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0046\n0.0069\n-0.66\n0.5065\n\n\n\na1\n0.3187\n0.0475\n6.71\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2207\n0.0141\n15.68\n<1e-54\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.0874\n0.0743\n1.18\n0.2391\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n0.0249\n0.0430\n0.58\n0.5621\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.0479\n0.0304\n-1.58\n0.1144\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.1037\n0.0234\n4.42\n<1e-05\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.0749\n0.0222\n-3.37\n0.0007\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.0117\n0.0127\n-0.92\n0.3569\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0159\n0.0090\n1.77\n0.0772\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.0192\n0.0069\n2.76\n0.0057\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0288\n0.0475\n0.61\n0.5444\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0460\n0.0743\n0.62\n0.5353\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0021\n0.0430\n-0.05\n0.9612\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0456\n0.0304\n-1.50\n0.1332\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0064\n0.0234\n0.27\n0.7837\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7744\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe forego a detailed discussion of the effects, but note that again none of the interactions between age x Sex with the four test contrasts was significant.\nThe default labeling of Helmert contrasts may lead to confusions with other contrasts. Therefore, we could provide our own labels:\nlabels=[\"c2.1\", \"c3.12\", \"c4.123\", \"c5.1234\"]\nOnce the order of levels is memorized the proposed labelling is very transparent.\n\n\n2.3 HypothesisCoding: contr3\nThe third set of contrasts uses HypothesisCoding. Hypothesis coding allows the user to specify their own a priori contrast matrix, subject to the mathematical constraint that the matrix has full rank. For example, sport scientists agree that the first four tests can be contrasted with BPT, because the difference is akin to a correction of overall physical fitness. However, they want to keep the pairwise comparisons for the first four tests.\n\nHyC1: BPT - mean(1,2,3,4)\nHyC2: Star_r - Run_r\nHyC3: Run_r - S20_r\nHyC4: S20_r - SLJ\n\n\ncontr3 = Dict(\n  :School => Grouping(),\n  :Child => Grouping(),\n  :Cohort => Grouping(),\n  :Sex => EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n  :Test => HypothesisCoding(\n    [\n      -1 -1 -1 -1 +4\n      -1 +1 0 0 0\n       0 -1 +1 0 0\n       0 0 -1 +1 0\n    ];\n    levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"],\n    labels=[\"BPT-other\", \"Star-End\", \"S20-Star\", \"SLJ-S20\"],\n  ),\n);\n\n\nm_ovi_Hypo = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0182\n0.0141\n-1.29\n0.1971\n0.5752\n\n\nTest: BPT-other\n-0.0921\n0.1387\n-0.66\n0.5065\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End\n-0.0180\n0.0444\n-0.40\n0.6859\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star\n0.0017\n0.0440\n0.04\n0.9701\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20\n0.0152\n0.0438\n0.35\n0.7283\n\n\n\na1\n0.3187\n0.0475\n6.71\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2207\n0.0141\n15.68\n<1e-54\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other & a1\n2.0747\n0.4689\n4.42\n<1e-05\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End & a1\n0.1749\n0.1485\n1.18\n0.2391\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star & a1\n-0.0127\n0.1481\n-0.09\n0.9316\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20 & a1\n-0.2416\n0.1489\n-1.62\n0.1046\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other & Sex: Boys\n0.3832\n0.1387\n2.76\n0.0057\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End & Sex: Boys\n-0.1498\n0.0444\n-3.37\n0.0007\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star & Sex: Boys\n0.0399\n0.0440\n0.91\n0.3648\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20 & Sex: Boys\n0.0868\n0.0438\n1.98\n0.0472\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0288\n0.0475\n0.61\n0.5444\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1287\n0.4689\n0.27\n0.7837\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0921\n0.1485\n0.62\n0.5353\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0523\n0.1481\n-0.35\n0.7240\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1782\n0.1489\n-1.20\n0.2311\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7744\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith HypothesisCoding we must generate our own labels for the contrasts.

Consequently, the contrast specification has a big effect on the random-effect structure. As an illustration, we refit the LMMs with variance components (VCs) and correlation parameters (CPs) for Child-related contrasts of Test. Unfortunately, it is not easy, actually rather quite difficult, to grasp the meaning of correlations of contrast-based effects; they represent two-way interactions.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 1653      Time: 0:00:13 ( 8.09 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0165\n0.0141\n-1.17\n0.2410\n0.6486\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0410\n0.0435\n-0.94\n0.3465\n1.4332\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.0241\n0.1690\n0.14\n0.8865\n0.2973\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n-0.0208\n0.0777\n-0.27\n0.7886\n1.7921\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0006\n0.0441\n-0.01\n0.9883\n1.4138\n\n\na1\n0.3165\n0.0475\n6.66\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2211\n0.0141\n15.70\n<1e-54\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.5730\n0.1470\n3.90\n<1e-04\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n-1.2597\n0.5700\n-2.21\n0.0271\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.2697\n0.2599\n1.04\n0.2994\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.2401\n0.1497\n1.60\n0.1088\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0269\n0.0435\n0.62\n0.5371\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-0.6752\n0.1690\n-3.99\n<1e-04\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1660\n0.0777\n-2.14\n0.0326\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0836\n0.0441\n-1.90\n0.0578\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0198\n0.0475\n0.42\n0.6775\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0125\n0.1470\n0.08\n0.9324\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1414\n0.5700\n-0.25\n0.8041\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.2710\n0.2599\n1.04\n0.2971\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1626\n0.1497\n1.09\n0.2773\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.38889688\n0.62361597\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n2.30163261\n1.51711325\n+0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.83218917\n0.91224403\n-0.00\n-0.37\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.42428771\n0.65137371\n+0.46\n-0.25\n-0.51\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n1.02440159\n1.01212726\n-0.44\n-0.40\n-0.30\n+0.39\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00002303\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.32171909\n0.56720287\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.68019101\n0.82473693\n+0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.11259793\n0.33555614\n+0.21\n+0.26\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.01589177\n0.12606255\n+0.76\n+0.66\n+0.37\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.04019538\n0.20048787\n-0.12\n-0.29\n-0.52\n-0.60\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00005682\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.38195182\n0.61802251\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other\n2.94532576\n1.71619514\n+0.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End\n2.19399073\n1.48121259\n+0.21\n-0.41\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star\n1.00313081\n1.00156418\n+0.03\n+0.01\n-0.29\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20\n1.20125861\n1.09601944\n-0.05\n+0.19\n-0.26\n-0.28\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00001433\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.42069018\n0.64860633\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n2.05397850\n1.43317078\n-0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.08837422\n0.29727803\n+0.88\n-0.53\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n3.21171876\n1.79212688\n+0.23\n+0.05\n+0.17\n\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n1.99875650\n1.41377385\n-0.33\n-0.10\n-0.23\n-0.65\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00001418\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPs for the various contrasts are in line with expectations. For the SDC we observe substantial negative CPs between neighboring contrasts. For the orthogonal HeC, all CPs are small; they are uncorrelated. HyC contains some of the SDC contrasts and we observe again the negative CPs. The (roughly) PCA-based contrasts are small with one exception; there is a sizeable CP of +.41 between GM and the core of adjusted physical fitness (c234.15).\nDo these differences in CPs imply that we can move to zcpLMMs when we have orthogonal contrasts? We pursue this question with by refitting the four LMMs with zerocorr() and compare the goodness of fit.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child0 = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 632   Time: 0:00:02 ( 4.27 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nœÉ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0174\n0.0141\n-1.24\n0.2157\n0.6624\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0383\n0.0444\n-0.86\n0.3883\n1.4148\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.0029\n0.1703\n0.02\n0.9863\n0.0002\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n-0.0280\n0.0774\n-0.36\n0.7176\n2.1759\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0108\n0.0433\n-0.25\n0.8033\n1.1617\n\n\na1\n0.3166\n0.0475\n6.66\n<1e-10\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2214\n0.0141\n15.71\n<1e-54\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.5741\n0.1501\n3.83\n0.0001\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n-1.2636\n0.5743\n-2.20\n0.0278\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.2648\n0.2585\n1.02\n0.3057\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.2321\n0.1471\n1.58\n0.1144\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0254\n0.0444\n0.57\n0.5669\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-0.6635\n0.1703\n-3.89\n<1e-04\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1638\n0.0774\n-2.12\n0.0344\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0853\n0.0433\n-1.97\n0.0488\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0250\n0.0475\n0.53\n0.5994\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0195\n0.1501\n0.13\n0.8964\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0747\n0.5743\n-0.13\n0.8965\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.2759\n0.2585\n1.07\n0.2857\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1767\n0.1471\n1.20\n0.2294\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nœá¬≤\nœá¬≤-dof\nP(>œá¬≤)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + MixedModels.ZeroCorr((1 + Test | Child))\n26\n13810\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13317\n494\n10\n<1e-98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nœá¬≤\nœá¬≤-dof\nP(>œá¬≤)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + MixedModels.ZeroCorr((1 + Test | Child))\n26\n13339\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13353\n-14\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nœá¬≤\nœá¬≤-dof\nP(>œá¬≤)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + MixedModels.ZeroCorr((1 + Test | Child))\n26\n13332\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13315\n17\n10\n0.0803\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_PCA0, m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nœá¬≤\nœá¬≤-dof\nP(>œá¬≤)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + MixedModels.ZeroCorr((1 + Test | Child))\n26\n13287\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13319\n-32\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, we can not drop CPs from any of the LMMs. The full LMMs all have the same objective, but we can compare the goodness-of-fit statistics of zcpLMMs more directly.\n\nbegin\n  zcpLMM = [\"SDC0\", \"HeC0\", \"HyC0\", \"PCA0\"]\n  mods = [m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_PCA0]\n  gof_summary = sort!(\n    DataFrame(;\n      zcpLMM=zcpLMM,\n      dof=dof.(mods),\n      deviance=deviance.(mods),\n      AIC=aic.(mods),\n      BIC=bic.(mods),\n    ),\n    :deviance,\n  )\nend\n\n\n4 rows √ó 5 columnszcpLMMdofdevianceAICBICStringInt64Float64Float64Float641PCA02613287.113339.113508.62HyC02613331.513383.513553.03HeC02613338.713390.713560.14SDC02613810.413862.414031.8\n\n\nThe best fit was obtained for the PCA-based zcpLMM. Somewhat surprisingly the second best fit was obtained for the SDC. The relatively poor performance of HeC-based zcpLMM is puzzling to me. I thought it might be related to imbalance in design in the present data, but this does not appear to be the case. The same comparison of SequentialDifferenceCoding and Helmert Coding also showed a worse fit for the zcp-HeC LMM than the zcp-SDC LMM.\n\n\n3.3 VCs and CPs depend on random factor\nVCs and CPs resulting from a set of test contrasts can also be estimated for the random factor School. Of course, these VCs and CPs may look different from the ones we just estimated for Child.\nThe effect of age (i.e., developmental gain) varies within School. Therefore, we also include its VCs and CPs in this model; the school-related VC for Sex was not significant.\n\nf_School = @formula zScore ~\n  1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 + Test + a1 | School);\nm_School_SeqDiff = fit(MixedModel, f_School, dat; contrasts=contr1);\nm_School_Helmert = fit(MixedModel, f_School, dat; contrasts=contr2);\nm_School_Hypo = fit(MixedModel, f_School, dat; contrasts=contr3);\nm_School_PCA = fit(MixedModel, f_School, dat; contrasts=contr4);\n\nMinimizing 1232      Time: 0:00:01 ( 1.25 ms/it)\n  objective:  13770.812442093726\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_School_SeqDiff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\n(Intercept)\n0.022893\n0.151304\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.195868\n0.442570\n+0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.056103\n0.236860\n-0.03\n-0.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.085155\n0.291813\n-0.14\n-0.01\n-0.75\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.059631\n0.244195\n-0.36\n-0.54\n-0.02\n+0.23\n\n\n\n\na1\n0.038162\n0.195352\n+0.56\n+0.60\n+0.16\n-0.64\n-0.78\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.860122\n0.927428\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_School_Helmert)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\n(Intercept)\n0.0228860\n0.1512813\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.0489795\n0.2213132\n+0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0045592\n0.0675219\n+0.12\n+0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0021243\n0.0460898\n-0.14\n+0.26\n-0.66\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.0029319\n0.0541473\n-0.39\n-0.35\n-0.89\n+0.44\n\n\n\n\na1\n0.0381516\n0.1953243\n+0.56\n+0.61\n+0.84\n-0.39\n-0.91\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.8601386\n0.9274366\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_School_Hypo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\n(Intercept)\n0.022889\n0.151289\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other\n1.172913\n1.083011\n-0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End\n0.195838\n0.442536\n+0.14\n-0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star\n0.055988\n0.236619\n-0.02\n-0.43\n-0.61\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20\n0.085074\n0.291674\n-0.14\n+0.69\n-0.01\n-0.74\n\n\n\n\na1\n0.038145\n0.195308\n+0.56\n-0.91\n+0.60\n+0.15\n-0.64\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.860143\n0.927439\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_School_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\n(Intercept)\n0.022892\n0.151301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n0.077507\n0.278401\n-0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n3.329582\n1.824714\n+0.26\n+0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n0.103446\n0.321631\n+0.16\n+0.80\n+0.60\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n0.085118\n0.291750\n+0.14\n-0.61\n+0.36\n-0.19\n\n\n\n\na1\n0.038134\n0.195279\n+0.56\n-0.26\n+0.88\n+0.35\n+0.64\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.860122\n0.927427\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compare again how much of the fit resides in the CPs.\n\nbegin\n  f_School0 = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test + a1 | School)\n  m_School_SDC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_School0, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_School_HeC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_School0, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_School_HyC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_School0, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_School_PCA0 = fit(MixedModel, f_School0, dat; contrasts=contr4)\n  #\n  zcpLMM2 = [\"SDC0\", \"HeC0\", \"HyC0\", \"PCA0\"]\n  mods2 = [\n    m_School_SDC0, m_School_HeC0, m_School_HyC0, m_School_PCA0\n  ]\n  gof_summary2 = sort!(\n    DataFrame(;\n      zcpLMM=zcpLMM2,\n      dof=dof.(mods2),\n      deviance=deviance.(mods2),\n      AIC=aic.(mods2),\n      BIC=bic.(mods2),\n    ),\n    :deviance,\n  )\nend\n\nMinimizing 404   Time: 0:00:00 ( 0.63 ms/it)\n\n\n\n4 rows √ó 5 columnszcpLMMdofdevianceAICBICStringInt64Float64Float64Float641PCA02713790.113844.114020.12HeC02713791.713845.714021.73HyC02713795.513849.514025.54SDC02713799.313853.314029.2\n\n\nFor the random factor School the Helmert contrast, followed by PCA-based contrasts have least information in the CPs; SDC has the largest contribution from CPs.

    "text": "Example data\nWe take the KWDYZ dataset (Kliegl et al., 2010). This is an experiment looking at three effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). Two horizontal rectangles are displayed above and below a central fixation point or they displayed in vertical orientation to the left and right of the fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small visual target occuring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. Interestingly, a different theoretical perspective, derived from feature overlap, leads to a different set of contrasts. Can the results refute one of the theoretical perspectives?\nWe also have a dataset from a replication and extension of this study (Kliegl, Kuschela, & Laubrock, 2015). Both data sets are available in R-package RePsychLing"

In this case, you have six options for the first contrast, that is 6 vs.¬†1, 5 vs.2 , 4 vs.¬†3, 3 vs.¬†4, 2 vs.¬†5, and 1 vs.¬†6 levels. Then, you specify orthogonal contrasts for partitions with more than 2 elements and so on. That is, you don‚Äôt specify a contrast that crosses an earlier partition line.\nIn the following example, after an initial 4 vs 3 partitioning of levels, we specify AnovaCoding for the left and HelmertCoding for the right partition.\n\ncontrasts = Dict(\n  :CTR => HypothesisCoding(\n    [\n      -1/4 -1/4 -1/4 -1/4 +1/3 +1/3 +1/3\n      -1/2 -1/2 +1/2 +1/2 0 0 0\n      -1/2 +1/2 -1/2 +1/2 0 0 0\n      +1/2 -1/2 -1/2 +1/2 0 0 0\n      0 0 0 0 -1 +1 0\n      0 0 0 0 -1/2 -1/2 1\n    ];\n    levels=[\"A1\", \"A2\", \"A3\", \"A4\", \"A5\", \"A6\", \"A7\"],\n    labels=[\"c567.1234\", \"B\", \"C\", \"BxC\", \"c6.5\", \"c6.56\"],\n  ),\n);\n\nThere are two rules that hold for all orthogonal contrasts:\n\nThe weights within rows sum to zero.\nFor all pairs of rows, the sum of the products of weights in the same columns sums to zero."
