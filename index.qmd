This site provides materials for the **Advanced frequentist methods** stream of the [Summer School on Statistical Methods](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2022/) to be held at the University of Potsdam, 12-16 September, 2022

# Installation of tools prior to the course

This section of the summer school will use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and related tools. Because most participants have more experience with [R](https://r-project.org) and the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE), it is necessary to install and configure several software systems prior to the course.

## git

We will assume that you have git installed and are able to clone a repository from github. This website is built using [quarto](https://quarto.org), described below, from a [git repository] (https://github.com/RePsychLing/SMLP2022). Clone this repository with, e.g.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RePsychLing/SMLP2022
```

## Julia Programming Language 

We will use Julia v1.8.0 in the summer school. You can download the version appropriate for your setup from here: [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

We will use VS Code IDE, that is Julia : VS Code ~ R : RStudio. You can download the version appropriate for your setup from here: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Quarto 

The web site and other documents for this course are rendered using a `knitr`-like system called Quarto. You can download the version appropriate for your setup from here: [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

# Summary

We assume everybody will succeed with the installations. If not, please get in touch! 

You may also want to give it a try to get these tools to play nicely with each other -- but don't spend too much time on this.
